# 100 Days Of JavaScript

This is a collection of 100 days of JavaScript projects. Each day I will create a new project using vanilla JavaScript. The projects will be simple and easy to understand. I will also add a README.md file to each project with a description of the project and how to run it.

## Day 1 - Counter App

This is a simple counter app using vanilla JavaScript.
